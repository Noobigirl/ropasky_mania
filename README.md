# 🎭 Ropasky Mania 

## 👩🏿‍🔧 Basic Explanation

Rock, Paper, Scissors… with a wild twist! That’s the spirit of **Ropasky Mania**, a fast-paced, turn-based party strategy game where you go head-to-head against a cunning bot

---

## 💡 Motivation

I recently modded my 3DS (a gift from a friend) and spent hours playing Pokémon and *WarioWare, Inc.*  
Pokémon’s turn-based battles and WarioWare’s RPS minigame inspired me to mix both styles into a fresh, strategic twist on RPS.

Also, I want to test how much I’ve improved since my last Godot project.

## 🎮 Gameplay Description

- The game starts with a short countdown.
- Pick your move before the timer runs out.
- Both choices are revealed at the same time.
- Game logic determines the winner.
- Score updates → next round begins.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Rock, Paper, Scissors... and more custom moves!
- Multiple difficulty levels for bots
- Countdown timer to add pressure and intensity.
- Smooth hand animations (I'll try my best) and visuals.
- Custom interactions between moves (not adde yet).

---

## 🚀 Stretch Goals

- Multiplayer 1v1 mode
- Customizable hand skins (unlockable)
- Leaderboards

---

## 🥳 Success Criteria

I will consider the project complete if:

- All key features work properly (ESPECIALY THE ANIMATIONS)
- The game is playable from start to finish
- A polished splash screen and menu are included
- The game is uploaded to GitHub with screenshots and gameplay videos
- It’s published on Itch.io with a good description and visuals

## 🪽 Summary of the dev process
Compared to my last project, this one went a lot more smoothly. The biggest challenges were adding the bot’s hand 
to the main scene and making it independent from the player’s hand (I’m still getting used to how Godot handles OOP), as well as building the bot algorithms for each difficulty level. 
I really enjoyed making the art myself, and I was especially proud of the music (I honestly didn’t expect it to turn out that well.)
